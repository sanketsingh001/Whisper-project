Hello Ma'am, I am talking about Bank of Borda Selection.
I am talking to <PERSON>.
Yes, I am Sajida.
Before moving forward, I would like to tell you that I am a Call Recorder regarding Quality Training Purpose.
<PERSON>, the personal loan you have financed from Bank of Borda, whose account number is <DATE_TIME>.
Ma'am, its overdue amount is Rs.44.
You haven't paid the amount for <DATE_TIME>.
I would like to know why you haven't paid the amount.
I didn't know because the online payment is cut.
Ma'am, the auto-debit is done through your account.
But your amount is less than Rs.44.
So, you have to pay this Rs.44 <DATE_TIME>.
Then, I will have to pay it after the payment is cut.
Ma'am, your loan account is linked to your savings account.
Your account is Bank of Borda, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
So, if you make a payment through it,
the auto-debit will be done through your account.
Yes.
So, I will go there.
Yes.
So, I will keep you in touch.
I will be on line.
You make the payment now.
It will be updated soon.
I will also update it here so that you don't get calls again and again.
No.
I want to ask you something.
It has been <DATE_TIME> since I got the loan.
Ma'am, your outstanding amount is showing.

Okay.

Yes.
That's it.
So, we will get the loan again.

How did you take the loan?
Did you take it online or did you take the loan by visiting the bank?

Then, you will have a problem.
You also do it now.
